### 👋 Hello!


🔭 I’m currently working on https://typelog.dev, which is a thinking and writing platform for developers.

- ✍🏼 Write markdown (GFM) and leave comments.
- 🧻 Multiple feeds for whatever.
- 📶 RSS for every feed.
- 🐹 Written for developers (syntax highlighting). 
- 🧑‍🌾 Not a silo (webmentions coming soon).
- 🌏 Get started at https://typelog.dev. 

🚧 Want to see progress?
